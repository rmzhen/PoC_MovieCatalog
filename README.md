# PoC_MovieCatalog
This is a PoC project made to research the workings of microservices. For this project I've followed [this workshop](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTZSKAFG6aCDVDP86Qx4lNas) to get familiar with microservices. 

Personal notes I've made can be found [here](https://github.com/rmzhen/PoC_MovieCatalog/blob/main/Personal_Spring_Boot_Java_microservices_notes.md).
